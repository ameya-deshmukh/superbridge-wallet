## About

# Acknowledgements 

A lot of the starter code for the wallet for generating and importing wallets was inspired by the wonderful repositories by [TMSDev (for Solana)] (https://github.com/tmsdev82/solana-wallet-tutorial) and [
[ilmoi (for Ethereum/EVM-compatible chains)] (https://github.com/ilmoi/eth-rust-wallet).
