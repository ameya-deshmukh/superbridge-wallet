# Superbridge Wallet 

## About
Superbridge is a CLI wallet that supports bridging of assets across chains using the [Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/) cross-chain messaging protocol. 

## Acknowledgements 

A lot of the starter code for the wallet for generating and importing wallets was inspired by the wonderful repositories by [TMSDev (for Solana)](https://github.com/tmsdev82/solana-wallet-tutorial) and [ilmoi (for Ethereum/EVM-compatible chains)](https://github.com/ilmoi/eth-rust-wallet).
